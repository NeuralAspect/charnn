When I first started out in machine learning in 2017 I was hung up with terminology. 
My company had a hunch that we could use AI somehow to make use of the large amounts of data that we were 
collecting and provide our users with insights and recommend actions to take. The problem was that I hadn't 
a clue what I was doing and I didn't know where to start. I somehow convinced myself that I needed to get a clear 
understanding of what the differences were between AI and Machine Learning. Days would go by trawling the internet 
trying to find the answer. Eventually, I stumbled upon the Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course and I started 
to understand what Machine Learning was and how it could be applied. This led on to more formal training and years of 
practical experience and now I'm a proficient data scientist. I'm not about to unlock the secrets of AGI, but I'm perfectly 
capable of creating custom deep learning models from scratch, reading and writing research papers and making commercially 
successful AI software. The point I want to make is this: Somewhere along the way I realised that the question I was 
trying to answer at the outset mattered the least. I didn't need to know the difference between AI and Machine Learning. 
I just needed to know how to use the tools available in order to solve the problem at hand. Having said all that, 
let me give you my take on how to define these terms.
